# Pump-It-Up-Competition
This is my submission for the Pump It Up Kaggle Competition. Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we must predict which pumps are functional, need some repairs, and which don't work at all. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

This repo contains my entire process from EDA, data cleaning, feature selection and modelling work for this DrivenData competition, where I currently hold a top 15% score (0.8172).
